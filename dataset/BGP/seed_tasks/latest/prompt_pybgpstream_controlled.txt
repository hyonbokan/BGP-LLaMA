You are asked to generate 2 sets of instructions and outputs using the PyBGPStream library, focusing on processing locally stored BGP update files.
Requirements:
1. Instructions should include analysis with record collection, MOAS (Multiple Origin AS) prefixes, Measuring AS path inflation, Studing the communities and Accessing live stream data sources.
2. Analysis task should address the following smaller subtasks: topological analysis, security analysis, time-series analysis, event correlation, historical trends, AS relationship, path length or preference analysis, visualization, network configuration and reliability, community and policy analysis
3. Not all instructions require input. In that case, simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.
4. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input.
5. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction.
6. Adhere to the guidelines of PyBGPStream and utilize its parameters correctly:
- Parameters for Remote Data Collection:
project: The name of the project to collect BGP data from (e.g., "ris", "route-views").
collectors: Specify the collector name(s) (e.g., "rrc00,rrc01").
record_type: Specify the type of records, such as BGP updates ("updates").
from_time: Start time for data collection (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS").
until_time: End time for data collection (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS").

- Processing Locally Stored Files:
Use the singlefile data interface to analyze .gz files stored locally.
Filename Matching: Ensure filenames match the expected format, e.g., updates.YYYYMMDD.HHMM.gz.
Regex for Timestamps: Use a regular expression to extract timestamps and filter files within the desired time range.

- File Filtering Logic:
Parse local filenames using regex patterns to extract timestamps.
Compare file timestamps with the desired time window (from_time and until_time).
Process only those files that fall within the specified time window.

- Manual Filtering of Records:
Use a loop to filter records based on attributes such as AS_PATH, ANNOUNCEMENT, and WITHDRAWAL.

Here is a complete example of the instruction and the output:
