Design a comprehensive set of tasks to assess the GPT model's understanding of BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) concepts, configuration, attributes, message types, and operational aspects. The tasks should encompass definitions, explanations, practical scenarios, and analysis. Evaluate the GPT model's responses based on the accuracy, depth, and coherence of the BGP-related knowledge it provides in its answers.

Here are the requirements:
1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.
2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.
3. The type of instructions should be diverse. The list should include diverse types of tasks like BGP basics definitions and concepts,  BGP configuration, BGP path attributes, types BGP messages and how to handle them, BGP route aggregation, route hijacking, monitoring and analysis, etc.
4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction.
5. The instructions should be in English.
6. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
7. You should generate an appropriate instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 150 words
8. Not all instructions require input. For example, when a instruction asks about some general information, such as "What is BGP(Border Gateway Protocol)?", it is not necssary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.
9. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 100 words.
