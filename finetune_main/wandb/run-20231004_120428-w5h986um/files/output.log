You're using a LlamaTokenizerFast tokenizer. Please note that with a fast tokenizer, using the `__call__` method is faster than using a method to encode the text followed by a call to the `pad` method to get a padded encoding.
`use_cache=True` is incompatible with gradient checkpointing. Setting `use_cache=False`...

<s>[INST] Explain what BGP blackholing activity is [/INST]  BGP blackholing is a technique used to filter out certain traffic by redirecting it to a blackhole route. This is done by advertising a route that has a longer AS path than any other route to the destination, thus making it impossible for the traffic to reach its destination. BGP blackholing activity is the intentional or unintentional use of this technique to filter out certain traffic.
Examples of BGP blackholing activity include:
1. Traffic interception and diversion by govern
<s>[INST] Perform BGP analysis using PyBGPStream and detect anomalies in AS path lengths for IPv4 prefixes over two time periods: from January 15, 2020, 15:00 to January 15, 2020, 17:00, and January 18, 2020, 12:00 to January 18, 2020, 13:00. [/INST]  To perform the analysis, you can use PyBGPStream to collect BGP data from the route-views.sydney route collector. Here's the code to do so:
import pybgpstream
# Initialize the BGPStream
stream = pybgpstream.BGPStream(
    from_time="2020-01-15 15:00:00", until_time="2020-01-15 17:00:00",

    record_type="updates",
    filter="ipversion 4"
)
# Initialize the dictionaries to store the AS path lengths
as_path_lengths = {}
# Loop through the stream records
for rec in stream.records():
    for elem in rec:
        if elem.type == "A":
            as_path = elem.fields.get('as-path', '').split()
            as_path_lengths[elem.fields['prefix']] = len(as_path)
# Perform the analysis
print("AS Path Lengths for IPv4 Prefixes:")
for prefix, as_path_length in as_path_lengths.items():
    print(f"Prefix: {prefix}, AS Path Length: {as_path_length}")
# Perform the analysis again for the second time period
stream = pybgpstream.BGPStream(

    filter="ipversion 4"
)
as_path_lengths = {}
for rec in stream.records():
    for elem in rec:
        if elem.type == "A":
            as_path = elem.fields.get('as-path', '').split()

# Detect anomalies in AS path lengths
for prefix, as_path_length in as_path_lengths.items():
    if as_path_length > 10:
        print(f"Anomaly Detected! Prefix: {prefix}, AS Path Length: {as_path_length}")
    else:
        print(f"Prefix: {prefix}, AS Path Length: {as_path_length}")

for prefix, as_path_length in as_path_lengths.items():
