You're using a LlamaTokenizerFast tokenizer. Please note that with a fast tokenizer, using the `__call__` method is faster than using a method to encode the text followed by a call to the `pad` method to get a padded encoding.
`use_cache=True` is incompatible with gradient checkpointing. Setting `use_cache=False`...

<s>[INST] Perform BGP analysis using PyBGPStream and detect anomalies in AS path lengths for IPv4 prefixes over two time periods: from January 15, 2020, 15:00 to January 15, 2020, 17:00, and January 18, 2020, 12:00 to January 18, 2020, 13:00. [/INST]  To perform BGP analysis using PyBGPStream and detect anomalies in AS path lengths for IPv4 prefixes over two time periods, you can follow these steps:
1. Install PyBGPStream:
```
pip install pybgpstream
```
2. Configure PyBGPStream to collect BGP data from the desired sources:
```
stream = pybgpstream.BGPStream(
    from_time="2020-01-15 15:00:00", until_time="2020-01-15 17:00:00",
    project="ris",
    collectors="rrc00",
    record_type="updates",
    filter="ipversion 4"
)
stream = pybgpstream.BGPStream(
    from_time="2020-01-18 12:00:00", until_time="2020-01-18 13:00:00",
    project="ris",
    collectors="rrc00",
    record_type="updates",
    filter="ipversion 4"
)
```
3. Analyze the data:
```
# Analyze the data
for rec in stream.records():
    for elem in rec:
        # Get the AS path length
        as_path_length = len(elem.fields['as-path'].split())
        # Get the AS path origin
        as_path_origin = elem.fields['as-path'].split()[-1]
        # Get the AS path origin ASN
        as_path_origin_asn = int(as_path_origin.split("_")[0])
        # Get the AS path origin country
        as_path_origin_country = as_path_origin.split("_")[1]
        # Get the AS path origin region
        as_path_origin_region = as_path_origin.split("_")[2]
        # Get the AS path origin city
        as_path_origin_city = as_path_origin.split("_")[3]
        # Get the AS path origin latitude
        as_path_origin_latitude = as_path_origin.split("_")[4]
        # Get the AS path origin longitude
        as_path_origin_longitude = as_path_origin.split("_")[5]
        # Get the AS path origin IP address
        as_path_origin_ip = elem.fields['peer-asn']
        # Get the AS path origin ASN
        as_path_origin_asn = int(as_path_origin.split("_")[0])
        # Get the AS path origin country
        as_path_origin_country = as_path_origin.split("_")[1]
        # Get the AS path origin region
        as_path_origin_region = as_path_origin.split("_")[2]
        # Get the AS path origin city
        as_path_origin_city = as_path_origin.split("_")[3]
        # Get the AS path origin latitude
        as_path_origin_latitude = as_path_origin.split("_")[4]
        # Get the AS path origin longitude
        as_path_origin_longitude = as_path_origin.split("_")[5]
        # Get the AS path origin IP address
        as_path_origin_ip = elem.fields['peer-asn']
        # Get the AS path length
        as_path_length = len(elem.fields['as-path'].split())
        # Get the AS path origin ASN
        as_path_origin_asn = int(as_path_origin.split("_")[0])
        # Get the AS path origin country
