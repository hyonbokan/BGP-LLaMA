0,"Based on the data provided, there are two anomalies detected:

1. Anomaly detected at 2017-12-12 04:40:00 due to high value of num_routes=77, num_new_routes=77, num_announcements=12086, num_unique_prefixes_announced=77.
2. Anomaly detected at 2017-12-12 05:05:00 due to high value of num_withdrawals=50.

The reason for the anomaly detection is provided in each case, along with the timestamp of the anomaly.

For the first anomaly, the values that are anomalous are num_routes=77, num_new_routes=77, num_announcements=12086, num_unique_prefixes_announced=77. These values are higher than the expected range, indicating a potential issue with the BGP monitoring data.

For the second anomaly, the value that is anomalous is num_withdrawals=50. This value is higher than the expected range, indicating a potential issue with the BGP monitoring data.

There are no other anomalies detected in the data provided."
1,"Based on the data provided, there is an anomaly detected at 2017-12-12 07:05:00. The reason for the anomaly is:

""anomaly detected at 2017-12-12 07:05:00 due to high value of num_routes=74, num_new_routes=74, num_withdrawals=2211, num_announcements=16467, num_unique_prefixes_announced=74.""

The values that are anomalous are:

* num_routes = 74
* num_new_routes = 74
* num_withdrawals = 2211
* num_announcements = 16467
* num_unique_prefixes_announced = 74

These values are significantly higher than the normal values for these metrics, indicating an anomaly in the BGP data."
2,"Based on the data provided, no anomaly is detected in the given time period. All the columns show consistent values throughout the time period, with no significant deviations or outliers.

The maximum value of num_routes is 1, which is within the normal range of 0 to 1. Similarly, the values of num_new_routes, num_withdrawals, num_origin_changes, num_route_changes, and max_path_length are all within the normal ranges.

The avg_path_length and max_edit_distance values are also within the normal ranges, with no significant deviations. The num_announcements value is 0, which is within the normal range of 0 to 1.

Therefore, based on the data provided, no anomaly is detected in the given time period."
