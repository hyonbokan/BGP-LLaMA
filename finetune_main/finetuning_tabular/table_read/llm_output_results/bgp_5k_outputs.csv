0,"Based on the data provided, there are two anomalies detected in the table:

1. Anomaly detected at 2017-12-12 04:40:00 due to high values of num_routes=77, num_new_routes=77, num_announcements=12086, num_unique_prefixes_announced=77.
2. Anomaly detected at 2017-12-12 04:50:00 due to high value of num_withdrawals=50.

Reason for anomaly 1:
The high values of num_routes, num_new_routes, num_announcements, and num_unique_prefixes_announced at 2017-12-12 04:40:00 indicate a significant increase in routing activity compared to the average activity in the time period. The high value of num_new_routes at 2017-12-12 04:40:00 suggests that there may have been a significant change in the routing policy or configuration at this time.

Reason for anomaly 2:
The high value of num_withdrawals at 2017-12-12 04:50:00 indicates that there may have been a sudden change in the routing policy or configuration, leading to a high number of withdrawals.

Therefore, the data indicates two anomalies at 2017-12-12 04:40:00 and 2017-12-12 04:50:00."
1,"Based on the data provided, an anomaly is detected at 2017-12-12 07:05:00. The reason for the anomaly is:

""anomaly detected at 2017-12-12 07:05:00 due to high value of num_routes=74, num_new_routes=74, num_withdrawals=2211, num_announcements=16467, num_unique_prefixes_announced=74.""

The values that are anomalous are:

* num_routes = 74
* num_new_routes = 74
* num_withdrawals = 2211
* num_announcements = 16467
* num_unique_prefixes_announced = 74

These values are higher than the expected norm, indicating a potential issue with the routing behavior of the AS 39523."
2,"Based on the data provided, an anomaly is detected at timestamp 2017-12-12 07:55:00.

The reason for the anomaly is that the number of new routes announced, num_new_routes = 1, is higher than the average value of 0.0 for the entire time period. This indicates that there was a significant increase in the number of new routes announced at this timestamp, which could be a sign of unusual routing activity.

Therefore, the anomaly status for the row at timestamp 2017-12-12 07:55:00 is set to ""yes""."
