Reason: High number of route changes (10, 10) and high number of unique prefixes announced (3, 3) in a short time period.

In each of these anomalies, the values that are anomalous are the number of route changes, the maximum edit distance, or the number of unique prefixes announced. These values are higher than what is typical in the given time period, indicating an anomaly in the BGP data."
3,"Based on the data provided, an anomaly is detected at 2022-03-28 13:35:00 with a reason of ""11 announcements, 9 withdrawals, and 0 origin changes, indicating a potential route change or path duration change"".

The anomaly is detected due to the following values:

* num_announcements = 11, which is higher than the average value of 4.0
* num_withdrawals = 9, which is higher than the average value of 0.0
* num_origin_changes = 0, which is lower than the average value of 0.2

These values indicate that there may have been a significant route change or path duration change in the network around the time of the anomaly. It is important to investigate further to determine the root cause of the anomaly and to ensure that the network is functioning as expected."

5,"Based on the data provided, an anomaly is detected at 2022-03-28 16:45:00 with a reason of ""max_edit_distance=3, avg_edit_distance=3.0"".

The anomaly occurs when analyzing the num_routes, num_new_routes, and num_withdrawals columns. Specifically, there are 1 instances where num_routes is 1, num_new_routes is 1, and num_withdrawals is 3. These values are anomalous because they are higher than the expected values for this time period.

For example, the max_edit_distance of 3 is higher than the expected average edit distance of 0.52, and the num_routes of 1 is higher than the expected number of routes at this time period of 8342.

Additionally, the num_announcements column also has an anomaly, with 1 instance where num_announcements is 3, which is higher than the expected value of 0.0.

Therefore, the data indicates an anomaly at 2022-03-28 16:45:00, with the anomalous values being max_edit_distance=3, avg_edit_distance=3.0, num_routes=1, num_new_routes=1, num_withdrawals=3, and num_announcements=3."
