This indicates that there were a large number of route changes in a short period of time, which is unusual.\n\nThe third anomaly is detected at timestamp 2022-03-28 16:25:00, where the number of routes (0) is anomalous. This indicates that there were no routes announced by this AS at this time, which is unusual.\n\nThe fourth anomaly is detected at timestamp 2022-03-28 16:45:00, where the number of routes (1) is anomalous.

This indicates that there was only one route announced by this AS at this time, which is unusual.\n\nThe reason for these anomalies is that there was a large number of route changes in a short period of time, which is unusual. Additionally, there were no new route announcements from certain ASes at specific times, which is also unusual.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, there are seven anomalies detected in the BGP data.

Here are the timestamps of the anomalies and the reasons explaining which values are anomalous:\n\n1. Anomaly detected at 2022-03-28 14:40:00 due to high value of num_routes=1; this is unusual as most of the time, the number of new routes is much higher than this.\n2. Anomaly detected at 2022-03-28 15:10:00 due to high value of num_routes=6; this is unusual as the number of new routes is much lower than this.\n3. Anomaly detected at 2022-03-28 15:55:00 due to high value of num_route_changes=4; this is unusual as the number of route changes is much higher than this.\n4. Anomaly detected at 2022-03-28 16:15:00 due to high value of num_routes=3, num_new_routes=3, num_route_changes=3; this is unusual as there are multiple anomalies in a short time span, including high values of num_routes and num_new_routes, and high number of route changes.\n\nIn summary, the data indicates that there are several anomalies in the BGP data, including high values of num_routes, num_new_routes, and route changes, as well as multiple anomalies in a short time span."
