An anomaly was detected at 2022-03-28 11:35:00 due to high values of num_routes=27, num_new_routes=27, num_unique_prefixes_announced=27.\n\nThe reason for the anomaly is that all three values are high, indicating a large number of routes and unique prefixes announced in a short time interval. This could be indicative of a network that is rapidly changing or evolving, or it could be a sign of a more malicious activity, such as a route leak or a prefix hijack.\n\nAdditionally, another anomaly was detected at 2022-03-28 11:40:00 due to high values of num_route_changes=27, max_path_length=6, avg_path_length=4.962962962962963, max_edit_distance=5, avg_edit_distance=3.2222222222222223. These values indicate a high level of route changes and path length changes in a short time interval, which could be indicative of a network that is highly dynamic or unstable.\n\nLastly, no anomalies were detected at 2022-03-28 11:50:00 and 2022-03-28 11:55:00, which suggests that the network was relatively stable during these time periods."
