For example, 'anomaly detected at 2024-06-10 12:00:00 due to high value of num_routes=77'",
        "output": "Based on the data provided, no anomaly is detected in the given time period.\n\nAll the columns except for \"num_announcements\" have a relatively stable value throughout the time period, with the maximum value of \"num_announcements\" being 16467 at timestamp 2017-12-12 07:05:00. However, the value of \"num_announcements\" at timestamp 2017-12-12 07:55:00 is 0, which is a departure from the norm.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that there is no anomaly detected in the given time period."
