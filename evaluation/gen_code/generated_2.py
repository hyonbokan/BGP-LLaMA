This script collects BGP updates from the 'rrc00' collector between March 1, 2023, 00:00:00 and March 1, 2023, 01:00:00. It filters the results to only include updates related to ASN 15169. For each update, it displays the timestamp, prefix, and AS path. 

Note: You need to have `pybgpstream` library installed to run this script. You can install it using pip: `pip install pybgpstream`. 

Also, make sure to replace the collector, time window, and filter as needed for your specific use case. 

Finally, this script assumes that the ASN 15169 is the peer ASN. If you want to filter based on the origin ASN, you should use the `origin` keyword in the filter instead of `peer`. For example: `filter="origin 15169"`. 

Please let me know if you need further assistance! 

Here is the output of the script:
