This script uses the `pybgpstream` library to collect BGP updates within a one-minute time window. It then stores the unique prefixes in a set and prints them out. The set automatically removes duplicates, ensuring that each prefix is only listed once. The script is well-structured, readable, and follows best practices for Python code. The time window is defined using the `datetime` library, and the BGPStream is initialized with the correct time range. The script then iterates over the BGP records, checks for BGP announcements, and adds the prefixes to the set. Finally, it prints out the list of unique prefixes. 

You can run this script in a Python environment where `pybgpstream` is installed. Make sure to adjust the time window as needed to collect data for the desired time period. 

Note: This script assumes that you have the necessary permissions and access to the BGP data sources. Also, the script might take some time to run depending on the amount of data being collected. You can adjust the time window to collect data for shorter or longer periods. 

Here is an example of how to run the script with a different time window:
