        "question": "What is the significance of mmWave frequencies in 5G, and how do they impact network coverage and capacity?",
        "answer": "mmWave frequencies in 5G offer high bandwidth but limited coverage. They are crucial for delivering ultra-fast speeds and supporting high-capacity applications in dense urban areas. However, their shorter range requires more base stations for coverage, making network planning and deployment challenging."
