Initialize the script by setting up a BGPStream instance configured to fetch updates from the 'ris-live' project. Prepare two pandas DataFrames, one each for tracking announcements and withdrawals, with columns for the time of the update, the prefix involved, and a count of occurrences. Design a function called process_bgp_data that operates continuously for a predetermined duration, here 180 seconds, to collect BGP updates. Within this function, filter the updates to identify those related to the AS of interest and update the respective DataFrame by either adding a new row for each unique prefix occurrence or incrementing the count for existing entries. Implement a mechanism to print out the top 5 prefixes by count from each DataFrame every 60 seconds, showcasing the most frequent announcements and withdrawals during that period before resetting the DataFrames for the next cycle of data collection. Initiate this data collection process in a separate thread to allow for concurrent execution without blocking other operations. Ensure that the entire script is designed to provide insights into the most active prefixes related to the specified AS within the live BGP feed, offering valuable information on BGP dynamics over a short, specified timeframe.\"\n",
