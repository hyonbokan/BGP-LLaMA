Anomaly detected at 2019-05-08 15:05:00 due to high value of num_new_routes=7. This is an anomaly because the normal value for this column is 0, and the sudden appearance of a large number of new routes at this timestamp is unusual.\\n3. Anomaly detected at 2019-05-08 15:10:00 due to high value of num_withdrawals=183. This is an anomaly because the normal value for this column is 0, and the sudden appearance of a large number of withdrawals at this timestamp is unusual.\\n4. Anomaly detected at 2019-05-08 15:15:00 due to high value of num_origin_changes=2. This is an anomaly because the normal value for this column is 0, and the sudden appearance of a large number of origin changes at this timestamp is unusual.\\n5. Anomaly detected at 2019-05-08 15:20:00 due to high value of num_route_changes=6. This is an anomaly because the normal value for this column is 0, and the sudden appearance of a large number of route changes at this timestamp is unusual.\\n6. Anomaly detected at 2019-05-08 15:25:00 due to high value of max_path_length=6.0. This is an anomaly because the normal value for this column is 0, and the sudden appearance of a large value for max path length at this timestamp is unusual.\\n7. Anomaly detected at 2019-05-08 15:30:00 due to high value of avg_path_length=4.0. This is an anomaly because the normal value for this column is 0, and the sudden appearance of a large value for avg path length at this timestamp is unusual.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the provided data, there are several anomalies detected at specific timestamps during the 15-minute period on May 8th, 2019. These anomalies are indicated by high values for various columns, such as num_routes, num_new_routes, num_withdrawals, num_origin_changes, num_route_changes, max_path_length, and avg_path_length.'}, {'instruction': 'The goal for this task is to determine if the data indicates an anomaly.
