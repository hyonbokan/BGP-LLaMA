,Title,Abstract
0,The missing links in the BGP-based AS connectivity maps,"A number of recent studies of the Internet topology at the autonomous systems
level (AS graph) are based on the BGP-based AS connectivity maps (original
maps). The so-called extended maps use additional data sources and contain more
complete pictures of the AS graph. In this paper, we compare an original map,
an extended map and a synthetic map generated by the Barabasi-Albert model. We
examine the recently reported rich-club phenomenon, alternative routing paths
and attack tolerance. We point out that the majority of the missing links of
the original maps are the connecting links between rich nodes (nodes with large
numbers of links) of the extended maps. We show that the missing links are
relevant because links between rich nodes can be crucial for the network
structure."
1,Analyzing and modelling the AS-level Internet topology,"Recently we introduced the rich-club phenomenon as a quantitative metric to
characterize the tier structure of the Autonomous Systems level Internet
topology (AS graph) and we proposed the Interactive Growth (IG) model, which
closely matches the degree distribution and hierarchical structure of the AS
graph and compares favourble with other available Internet power-law topology
generators. Our research was based on the widely used BGP AS graph obtained
from the Oregon BGP routing tables. Researchers argue that Traceroute AS graph,
extracted from the traceroute data collected by the CAIDA's active probing
tool, Skitter, is more complete and reliable. To be prudent, in this paper we
analyze and compare topological structures of Traceroute AS graph and BGP AS
graph. Also we compare with two synthetic Internet topologies generated by the
IG model and the well-known Barabasi-Albert (BA) model. Result shows that both
AS graphs show the rich-club phenomenon and have similar tier structures, which
are closely matched by the IG model, however the BA model does not show the
rich-club phenomenon at all."
2,Revisiting Internet AS-level Topology Discovery,"The development of veracious models of the Internet topology has received a
lot of attention in the last few years. Many proposed models are based on
topologies derived from RouteViews BGP table dumps (BTDs). However, BTDs do not
capture all AS-links of the Internet topology and most importantly the number
of the hidden AS-links is unknown, resulting in AS-graphs of questionable
quality. As a first step to address this problem, we introduce a new
AS-topology discovery methodology that results in more complete and accurate
graphs. Moreover, we use data available from existing measurement facilities,
circumventing the burden of additional measurement infrastructure. We deploy
our methodology and construct an AS-topology that has at least 61.5% more
AS-links than BTD-derived AS-topologies we examined. Finally, we analyze the
temporal and topological properties of the augmented graph and pinpoint the
differences from BTD-derived AS-topologies."
3,Inferring AS Relationships: Dead End or Lively Beginning?,"Recent techniques for inferring business relationships between ASs have
yielded maps that have extremely few invalid BGP paths in the terminology of
Gao. However, some relationships inferred by these newer algorithms are
incorrect, leading to the deduction of unrealistic AS hierarchies. We
investigate this problem and discover what causes it. Having obtained such
insight, we generalize the problem of AS relationship inference as a
multiobjective optimization problem with node-degree-based corrections to the
original objective function of minimizing the number of invalid paths. We solve
the generalized version of the problem using the semidefinite programming
relaxation of the MAX2SAT problem. Keeping the number of invalid paths small,
we obtain a more veracious solution than that yielded by recent heuristics."
4,Lessons from Three Views of the Internet Topology,"Network topology plays a vital role in understanding the performance of
network applications and protocols. Thus, recently there has been tremendous
interest in generating realistic network topologies. Such work must begin with
an understanding of existing network topologies, which today typically consists
of a relatively small number of data sources. In this paper, we calculate an
extensive set of important characteristics of Internet AS-level topologies
extracted from the three data sources most frequently used by the research
community: traceroutes, BGP, and WHOIS. We find that traceroute and BGP
topologies are similar to one another but differ substantially from the WHOIS
topology. We discuss the interplay between the properties of the data sources
that result from specific data collection mechanisms and the resulting topology
views. We find that, among metrics widely considered, the joint degree
distribution appears to fundamentally characterize Internet AS-topologies: it
narrowly defines values for other important metrics. We also introduce an
evaluation criteria for the accuracy of topology generators and verify previous
observations that generators solely reproducing degree distributions cannot
capture the full spectrum of critical topological characteristics of any of the
three topologies. Finally, we release to the community the input topology
datasets, along with the scripts and output of our calculations. This
supplement should enable researchers to validate their models against real data
and to make more informed selection of topology data sources for their specific
needs."
5,The Internet AS-Level Topology: Three Data Sources and One Definitive Metric,"We calculate an extensive set of characteristics for Internet AS topologies
extracted from the three data sources most frequently used by the research
community: traceroutes, BGP, and WHOIS. We discover that traceroute and BGP
topologies are similar to one another but differ substantially from the WHOIS
topology. Among the widely considered metrics, we find that the joint degree
distribution appears to fundamentally characterize Internet AS topologies as
well as narrowly define values for other important metrics. We discuss the
interplay between the specifics of the three data collection mechanisms and the
resulting topology views. In particular, we show how the data collection
peculiarities explain differences in the resulting joint degree distributions
of the respective topologies. Finally, we release to the community the input
topology datasets, along with the scripts and output of our calculations. This
supplement should enable researchers to validate their models against real data
and to make more informed selection of topology data sources for their specific
needs."
6,AS Relationships: Inference and Validation,"Research on performance, robustness, and evolution of the global Internet is
fundamentally handicapped without accurate and thorough knowledge of the nature
and structure of the contractual relationships between Autonomous Systems
(ASs). In this work we introduce novel heuristics for inferring AS
relationships. Our heuristics improve upon previous works in several technical
aspects, which we outline in detail and demonstrate with several examples.
Seeking to increase the value and reliability of our inference results, we then
focus on validation of inferred AS relationships. We perform a survey with ASs'
network administrators to collect information on the actual connectivity and
policies of the surveyed ASs. Based on the survey results, we find that our new
AS relationship inference techniques achieve high levels of accuracy: we
correctly infer 96.5% customer to provider (c2p), 82.8% peer to peer (p2p), and
90.3% sibling to sibling (s2s) relationships. We then cross-compare the
reported AS connectivity with the AS connectivity data contained in BGP tables.
We find that BGP tables miss up to 86.2% of the true adjacencies of the
surveyed ASs. The majority of the missing links are of the p2p type, which
highlights the limitations of present measuring techniques to capture links of
this type. Finally, to make our results easily accessible and practically
useful for the community, we open an AS relationship repository where we
archive, on a weekly basis, and make publicly available the complete Internet
AS-level topology annotated with AS relationship information for every pair of
AS neighbors."
7,Path-independent load balancing with unreliable machines,"We consider algorithms for load balancing on unreliable machines. The
objective is to optimize the two criteria of minimizing the makespan and
minimizing job reassignments in response to machine failures. We assume that
the set of jobs is known in advance but that the pattern of machine failures is
unpredictable. Motivated by the requirements of BGP routing, we consider
path-independent algorithms, with the property that the job assignment is
completely determined by the subset of available machines and not the previous
history of the assignments. We examine first the question of performance
measurement of path-independent load-balancing algorithms, giving the measure
of makespan and the normalized measure of reassignments cost. We then describe
two classes of algorithms for optimizing these measures against an oblivious
adversary for identical machines. The first, based on independent random
assignments, gives expected reassignment costs within a factor of 2 of optimal
and gives a makespan within a factor of O(log m/log log m) of optimal with high
probability, for unknown job sizes. The second, in which jobs are first grouped
into bins and at most one bin is assigned to each machine, gives
constant-factor ratios on both reassignment cost and makespan, for known job
sizes. Several open problems are discussed."
8,Bounding the Bias of Tree-Like Sampling in IP Topologies,"It is widely believed that the Internet's AS-graph degree distribution obeys
a power-law form. Most of the evidence showing the power-law distribution is
based on BGP data. However, it was recently argued that since BGP collects data
in a tree-like fashion, it only produces a sample of the degree distribution,
and this sample may be biased. This argument was backed by simulation data and
mathematical analysis, which demonstrated that under certain conditions a tree
sampling procedure can produce an artificail power-law in the degree
distribution. Thus, although the observed degree distribution of the AS-graph
follows a power-law, this phenomenon may be an artifact of the sampling
process. In this work we provide some evidence to the contrary. We show, by
analysis and simulation, that when the underlying graph degree distribution
obeys a power-law with an exponent larger than 2, a tree-like sampling process
produces a negligible bias in the sampled degree distribution. Furthermore,
recent data collected from the DIMES project, which is not based on BGP
sampling, indicates that the underlying AS-graph indeed obeys a power-law
degree distribution with an exponent larger than 2. By combining this empirical
data with our analysis, we conclude that the bias in the degree distribution
calculated from BGP data is negligible."
9,Near-Deterministic Inference of AS Relationships,"The discovery of Autonomous Systems (ASes) interconnections and the inference
of their commercial Type-of-Relationships (ToR) has been extensively studied
during the last few years. The main motivation is to accurately calculate
AS-level paths and to provide better topological view of the Internet. An
inherent problem in current algorithms is their extensive use of heuristics.
Such heuristics incur unbounded errors which are spread over all inferred
relationships. We propose a near-deterministic algorithm for solving the ToR
inference problem. Our algorithm uses as input the Internet core, which is a
dense sub-graph of top-level ASes. We test several methods for creating such a
core and demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm to the core's size and
density, the inference period, and errors in the core.
We evaluate our algorithm using AS-level paths collected from RouteViews BGP
paths and DIMES traceroute measurements. Our proposed algorithm
deterministically infers over 95% of the approximately 58,000 AS topology
links. The inference becomes stable when using a week worth of data and as
little as 20 ASes in the core. The algorithm infers 2-3 times more peer-to-peer
relationships in edges discovered only by DIMES than in RouteViews edges,
validating the DIMES promise to discover periphery AS edges."
10,Combined Intra- and Inter-domain Traffic Engineering using Hot-Potato Aware Link Weights Optimization,"A well-known approach to intradomain traffic engineering consists in finding
the set of link weights that minimizes a network-wide objective function for a
given intradomain traffic matrix. This approach is inadequate because it
ignores a potential impact on interdomain routing. Indeed, the resulting set of
link weights may trigger BGP to change the BGP next hop for some destination
prefixes, to enforce hot-potato routing policies. In turn, this results in
changes in the intradomain traffic matrix that have not been anticipated by the
link weights optimizer, possibly leading to degraded network performance.
We propose a BGP-aware link weights optimization method that takes these
effects into account, and even turns them into an advantage. This method uses
the interdomain traffic matrix and other available BGP data, to extend the
intradomain topology with external virtual nodes and links, on which all the
well-tuned heuristics of a classical link weights optimizer can be applied. A
key innovative asset of our method is its ability to also optimize the traffic
on the interdomain peering links. We show, using an operational network as a
case study, that our approach does so efficiently at almost no extra
computational cost."
11,Beyond Node Degree: Evaluating AS Topology Models,"Many models have been proposed to generate Internet Autonomous System (AS)
topologies, most of which make structural assumptions about the AS graph. In
this paper we compare AS topology generation models with several observed AS
topologies. In contrast to most previous works, we avoid making assumptions
about which topological properties are important to characterize the AS
topology. Our analysis shows that, although matching degree-based properties,
the existing AS topology generation models fail to capture the complexity of
the local interconnection structure between ASs. Furthermore, we use BGP data
from multiple vantage points to show that additional measurement locations
significantly affect local structure properties, such as clustering and node
centrality. Degree-based properties, however, are not notably affected by
additional measurements locations. These observations are particularly valid in
the core. The shortcomings of AS topology generation models stems from an
underestimation of the complexity of the connectivity in the core caused by
inappropriate use of BGP data."
12,Fast dynamics in Internet topology: preliminary observations and explanations,"By focusing on what can be observed by running traceroute-like measurements
at a high frequency from a single monitor to a fixed destination set, we show
that the observed view of the topology is constantly evolving at a pace much
higher than expected. Repeated measurements discover new IP addresses at a
constant rate, for long period of times (up to several months). In order to
provide explanations, we study this phenomenon both at the IP, and at the
Autonomous System levels. We show that this renewal of IP addresses is
partially caused by a BGP routing dynamics, altering paths between existing
ASes. Furthermore, we conjecture that an intra AS routing dynamics is another
cause of this phenomenon."
13,Neighbor-Specific BGP: More Flexible Routing Policies While Improving Global Stability,"Please Note: This document was written to summarize and facilitate discussion
regarding (1) the benefits of changing the way BGP selects routes to selecting
the most preferred route allowed by export policies, or more generally, to
selecting BGP routes on a per-neighbor basis, (2) the safety condition that
guarantees global routing stability under the Neighbor-Specific BGP model, and
(3) ways of deploying this model in practice. A paper presenting the formal
model and proof of the stability conditions was published at SIGMETRICS 2009
and is available online."
14,A Survey on BGP Issues and Solutions,"BGP is the de facto protocol used for inter-autonomous system routing in the
Internet. Generally speaking, BGP has been proven to be secure, efficient,
scalable, and robust. However, with the rapid evolving of the Internet in the
past few decades, there are increasing concerns about BGS's ability to meet the
needs of the Internet routing. There are two major limitations of BGP which are
its failure to address several key security issues, and some operational
related problems. The design and ubiquity of BGP have complicated past efforts
at securing inter-domain routing. This paper surveys the past work related to
BGP security and operational issues. We explore the limitations and advantages
of proposed solutions in these two limitations."
15,BGP Route Analysis and Management Systems,"The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an important component in today's IP
network infrastructure. As the main routing protocol of the Internet, clear
understanding of its dynamics is crucial for configuring, diagnosing and
debugging Internet routing problems. Despite the increase in the services that
BGP provide such as MPLS VPNs, there is no much progress achieved in automating
the BGP management tasks. In this paper we discuss some of the problems
encountered by network engineers when managing BGP networks. We also describe
some of the open source tools and methods that attempt to resolve these issues.
Then we present some of the features that, if implemented, will ease BGP
management related tasks."

1,Network-Destabilizing Attacks,"The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) sets up routes between the smaller networks
that make up the Internet. Despite its crucial role, BGP is notoriously
vulnerable to serious problems, including (1) propagation of bogus routing
information due to attacks or misconfigurations, and (2) network instabilities
in the form of persistent routing oscillations. The conditions required to
avoid BGP instabilities are quite delicate. How, then, can we explain the
observed stability of today's Internet in the face of common configuration
errors and attacks? This work explains this phenomenon by first noticing that
almost every observed attack and misconfiguration to date shares a common
characteristic: even when a router announces egregiously bogus information, it
will continue to announce the same bogus information for the duration of its
attack/misconfiguration. We call these the ""fixed-route attacks"", and show
that, while even simple fixed-route attacks can destabilize a network, the
commercial routing policies used in today's Internet prevent such attacks from
creating instabilities."
2,Feasibility study on distributed simulations of BGP,"The Autonomous System (AS) topology of the Internet (up to 61k ASs) is
growing at a rate of about 10% per year. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
starts to show its limits in terms of the number of routing table entries it
can dynamically process and control. Due to the increasing routing information
processing and storage, the same trend is observed for routing model simulators
such as DRMSim specialized in large-scale simulations of routing models.
Therefore, DRMSim needs enhancements to support the current size of the
Internet topology and its evolution (up to 100k ASs). To this end, this paper
proposes a feasibility study of the extension of DRMSim so as to support the
Distributed Parallel Discrete Event paradigm. We first detail the possible
distribution models and their associated communication overhead. Then, we
analyze this overhead by executing BGP on a partitioned topology according to
different scenarios. Finally, we conclude on the feasibility of such a
simulator by computing the expected additional time required by a distributed
simulation of BGP compared to its sequential simulation."
0,"Preference Games and Personalized Equilibria, with Applications to Fractional BGP","We study the complexity of computing equilibria in two classes of network
games based on flows - fractional BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) games and
fractional BBC (Bounded Budget Connection) games. BGP is the glue that holds
the Internet together and hence its stability, i.e. the equilibria of
fractional BGP games (Haxell, Wilfong), is a matter of practical importance.
BBC games (Laoutaris et al) follow in the tradition of the large body of work
on network formation games and capture a variety of applications ranging from
social networks and overlay networks to peer-to-peer networks.
The central result of this paper is that there are no fully polynomial-time
approximation schemes (unless PPAD is in FP) for computing equilibria in both
fractional BGP games and fractional BBC games. We obtain this result by proving
the hardness for a new and surprisingly simple game, the fractional preference
game, which is reducible to both fractional BGP and BBC games.
We define a new flow-based notion of equilibrium for matrix games --
personalized equilibria -- generalizing both fractional BBC and fractional BGP
games. We prove not just the existence, but the existence of rational
personalized equilibria for all matrix games, which implies the existence of
rational equilibria for fractional BGP and BBC games. In particular, this
provides an alternative proof and strengthening of the main result in [Haxell,
Wilfong]. For k-player matrix games, where k = 2, we provide a combinatorial
characterization leading to a polynomial-time algorithm for computing all
personalized equilibria. For k >= 5, we prove that personalized equilibria are
PPAD-hard to approximate in fully polynomial time. We believe that the concept
of personalized equilibria has potential for real-world significance."
1,Route Distribution Incentives,"We present an incentive model for route distribution in the context of path
vector routing protocols and we focus on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). BGP
is the de-facto protocol for interdomain routing on the Internet. We model BGP
route distribution and computation using a game in which a BGP speaker
advertises its prefix to its direct neighbors promising them a reward for
further distributing the route deeper into the network, the neighbors do the
same thing with their neighbors, and so on. The result of this cascaded route
distribution is an advertised prefix and hence reachability of the BGP speaker.
We first study the convergence of BGP protocol dynamics to a unique outcome
tree in the defined game. We then proceed to study the existence of equilibria
in the full information game considering competition dynamics. We focus our
work on the simplest two classes of graphs: 1) the line (and the tree) graphs
which involve no competition, and 2) the ring graph which involves competition."
