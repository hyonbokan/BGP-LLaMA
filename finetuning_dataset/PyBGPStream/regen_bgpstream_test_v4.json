Make sure to use the correct syntax and parameters when specifying your filter rules.\n2. To get the most out of PyBGPStream, make use of its record types, filters and project parameters.\n3. Pay attention to the required inputs and outputs for each instruction.\n4. Be familiar with the different BGP data sources that PyBGPStream can provide.\n5. Get creative with the different tasks you can do with the library.\n6. Use the specificity parameter for filtering for specific prefix conditions.\n7. Use '!' to negate the result for AS path filtering.\n8. Ensure that the filter rules are not too specific or too generalized for a given analysis task.\n9. Pay attention to the data formats when specifying the time parameters.\n10. Take into account the difference between RIB and Update records when filtering. \n11. Remember that some instructions do not require input and should use \u201c<noinput>\u201d in the Input field.\n12. Experiment with the filter parameters to get more specific results.\n13. Make sure that the output is an appropriate response to the instruction and the input.\n14. Take advantage of the multiple origin AS prefixes when filtering.\n15. Utilize event correlation and communities filters for specific tasks.\n16. Utilize visualization for improved analysis.\n17. Analyze historical trends for better understanding of data.\n18. Use time series analysis for more detailed results.\n19. Pay attention to AS relationships when setting filter parameters.",
