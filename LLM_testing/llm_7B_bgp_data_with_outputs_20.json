If an anomaly is detected, include the timestamp of the anomaly data and provide a reason explaining which values are anomalous.

        "output": "Based on the data provided in the table, there are a few anomalies that can be detected:\n\n1. Anomaly detected at 2017-12-12 07:35:00. The value of num_routes = 1 is anomalous as it is different from the previous values, which were all 0.\n2. Anomaly detected at 2017-12-12 07:45:00. The value of num_routes = 1 is anomalous as it is different from the previous value of 0.\n3. Anomaly detected at 2017-12-12 07:50:00. The value of num_routes = 0 is anomalous as it is different from the previous values, which were all non-zero.\n\nReason for anomaly 1:\nThe value of num_routes = 1 at 2017-12-12 07:35:00 is anomalous because it is different from the previous values, which were all 0. This could indicate a network event or change that caused a temporary increase in the number of routes.\n\nReason for anomaly 2:\nThe value of num_routes = 1 at 2017-12-12 07:45:00 is anomalous because it is different from the previous value of 0. This could indicate a network event or change that caused a temporary increase in the number of routes.\n\nReason for anomaly 3:\nThe value of num_routes = 0 at 2017-12-12 07:50:00 is anomalous because it is different from the previous values, which were all non-zero. This could indicate a network event or change that caused a temporary decrease in the number of routes.\n\nTherefore, the anomalies are detected at timestamps 2017-12-12 07:35:00, 2017-12-12 07:45:00, and 2017-12-12 07:50:00."
